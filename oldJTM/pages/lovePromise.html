Subaru in making the world a better place. That's why they've build fuel-efficient vehicles in eco-friendly plants. That's why, over the past 20 years, they've donated more than 50 million dollars to causes we all care about, and their employees have logged more than 28,000 volunteer hours.
<br><br>
Enter the Subaru Love Promise. It's a pledge to do right by the communities in which we all live and work. We've signed it, and throughout the country, our fellow Subaru retailers are doing the same. This is our promise to continue making a positive impact in the world and our neighborhoods.
